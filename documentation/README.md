# Introduction

PlanetServer provides access to calibrated hyper- and multispectral, topographic data on Solar System bodies. The main focus is on Mars and the Moon. Under page www.planetserver.eu, you can access to the client server.(cited from PlanetServer webpage)  

PlanetServer is a Service component of the EC-funded EarthServer-2 project (#654367) aimed at serving and analyzing planetary data online, mainly through OGC Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS). The focus of PlanetServer is on complex data, particularly hyperspectral imaging and topographic ones. Data from Mars, the Moon and other Solar System Bodies will be available and queriable.(cited from PlanetServer webpage)

As you can see, you can choose projections as you like and also, there are two available base maps that you can choose (Viking Mosaic and MOLA colored)  

'Search Location' can lead you to spot where you would like to investigate after clicking 'Goto'.  

Second part of the expanded menu shows you RGB queries.

You can input different members into RGB bands and see how does it look like after combined by using 'Combine' button.  

Also it's possible to select coverage bands and also WCPS Custom Queries by using functions inside this menu.  

On the top left, there are three buttons available. First button like character 'i' is the information menu. You can check several words regarding the introduction of PlanetServer and also some references and contacts of PlanetServer.
